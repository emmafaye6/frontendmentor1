# Front end mentor challenge: Product Preview Card Component

## Description
- Simple HTML and CSS project with Prettier
- [Front End Mentor Challenge] (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa)
- The challenge for this project was to make a Product Preview Card Component that was fully responsive with a mobile-first approach. 
- This challenge made responsive design a little bit clearer to me. My biggest struggle was figuring out how to go from a top image for the mobile version to a side image for the desktop version. I completed this project in two days and I'd say it went pretty smoothly even though it's not perfect by any means.
